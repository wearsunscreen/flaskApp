cd flask-firebase-auth-template

### 2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Configuration

#### Firebase Setup 
- Create Firebase account (https://firebase.google.com/)
- Go to the Firebase Console.
- Add a new project.
- Add web app to project.
- Go to "Project Settings" > Scroll to "SDK setup and configuration" > Select "Config" radio button and copy "firebaseConfig" data.
- Paste "firebaseConfig" data into firebase-config.js file (located in static folder).
- Paste "firebaseConfig" data into firebase-config.py file (adjust format to make it a valid python dict).
- Navigate to the "Firestore Database" section and create your database (if required for your project).
- Go to "Project Settings" > "Service accounts" > "Firebase Admin SDK" > Python option > click on the "Generate new private key" button > Download the JSON file.
- Place the downloaded JSON file in your project directory and rename it to firebase-auth.json.
- Navigate to "Buid" > "Authentication" section > click "Sign-in Method" and enable sign-in for Email/Password and Google options.
- Inside the "Autentication" section > click "Settings" > "Authorized Domains" and add your website domain to allow it to use the Google sign pop up in (localhost is authorized by default).

#### Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

SECRET_KEY=add_your_secret_key_here


### 4. Run the application

python app.py

This will start the Flask application on http://localhost:5000 by default.

### 5. Customize the template to build your own app.

To add private pages (requiring authentication to view) add the @auth_required decorator to the route. 

Example:

@app.route('/dashboard')
@auth_required
def dashboard():
    return "This is a private page that requires authentication to view"
